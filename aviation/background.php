            <p>Here you will find the my journey to fulfilling my dream of becoming a pilot. It's a dream that has been birthed inside of me since I was a boy and only now am I beginning to actively chase after it.
                <br/> This is taken from the movie Inception (2010).<br/>

            <div class="six columns right">
                <p>During my school days, I always dreamed of getting my pilots license, what would it be like to be up there away from all pollution, noise etc. To be where the birds fly, away from human intervention. How rad
                    must this be. One of my class mates started his pilots license while he was at school and I would always think, one day I'll be there :) Throughout my highschool career, I always held onto the dream, I never gave up
                    on it and even though it looks so far away and so unatainable, I still held onto it.

                    Growing up, we never really had any extra spare money so trying to save was near impossible thus me wanting to save up R70 000 for my license back then was seriously unrealistic as although I was working, I never had the gusto
                    to follow the dream as I had more important things on the agenda. While I'm writing this, I'm reminded of the one time when my family and I had to eat rice for breakfast, lunch and supper and had cold showers in the morning
                    and at night and sat doing homework under the gentle caress of candle light; I will admit it, we were poor. All this leads up to the motivation for obtaining my pilots license :)

                    You know, when you grow up (physically and literally speaking), you begin to stop (or atleast I hope so :P) thinking with a child like mind and start thinking about adult "topics."
                    When thinking with child like thoughts, I thought being a pilot was firstly to attract chicks (I mean which chick out there doesn't dig a pilot?? lol), then to earn lots of money and live the dream job etc. Knowing where I came from
                    and knowing how it feels to literally survive (not live) day by day when you don't know where the next meal comes has also become a motivating factor to in obtaining my license. When I do fly, I'm wanting to humanitarian work as how much more
                    joy can one get by using your talents and gifts to help the poor and destitute.

                <p>Last year, I saw this series on Discovery Channel about bush pilots in africa (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3183360" target="_blank">Bush Pilots</a>) and yes that perked my interest very quickly not because of the money they earn but moreover the awesome wildlife they see on a daily basis. These were the pilots of
                    Maun in Botswana. When I saw this series, I was very excited and was like dude, I can totally do this! but then the series ended and reality hit, how would I be helping/giving back to humanity if I'm flying tourists into african safari lodges?
                    So I had to question the excitment I had. At the beginning of this year, I saw a series called <a  href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4105938" target="_blank">Worst Place to be a Pilot</a> where the crew follows pilots that do mountain relief flying in  Indonesia. They
                    deliver food, water, medicine, petrol and other <span class="text-bold">critial</span> supplies to the remote mountain villages that are not acessible by vehicle. When I saw this, my heart almost gave itself a heart attack! That my son is what I'm wanting to do!
                    How kickass would this be: I'm getting to help sustain a village(s) and on one episode, this pilot is allowed to interact with and be apart of the diverse cultures. That is humbling man! The amount of fullfillment must be tremendous!
                    So that is what I've set my heart on

                    Now you know the background to the dream, lets get onto the motivation. For brevity, I'll summarise:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        As I was never given the money to be able to follow your dreams, me completing will prove to myself and others that if you set your mind to something, regardless of circumstances, it will happen
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Many times, I could've done like so many have and said "To hell with this, I'm not going to amount to being a pilot, I'll take a 'second class' job" - knowing this would leave me massively unsatisfied which brings me onto point 3
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One thing I have said to myself is that I do <span class="text-bold">not</span> want to live with regret - I know too many people and have read about the many people that in their 70's wish they had persued their dreams and would give anything to
                        to go back and try again as they know the deep rooted pain regret does.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I want to make my mom and dad proud - and give them the satisfaction of knowing that they didn't bring up a quitter who at the first sign of trouble bolts for the hills. I want them to say, depite of everything that has happend, look at what my sons have
                        done with their lives. That will give them a much deeper satifaction than anything monetary
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They say job satifaction is mandatory if you want to enjoy life to its fullest. I know too many people that are coining it and actually are as miserable as hell because they not doing the thing that keeps them going in the morning i.e.
                        <br/>For me, being able to help another human being is more rewarding than living in mansion and having so much money. To be dead honest, it would be make very uncomfortable knowing that I have a warm meal every night and drive a fancy ass car when there are people who battling to survive on a day to day basis and even though I
                        clearly have the means to help, I give a crumb away. <span class="text-bold text-underline">Please note: I'm not despising people who do this, its their choice</span>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-bold">Final Thoughts</h2>

            <p>
                Follow your dreams at ALL costs. Do <span class="text-bold text-underline"> NOT </span> give your dreams up for anybody, not for your husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend, even (yes I'll say it) your family. It might seem selfish but at the end of the day, God has given you 1 life and there are dreasm that are inside of you. It's up to you to make them happen! :)
